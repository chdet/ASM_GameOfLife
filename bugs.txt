* Visual glitches when simulation loop is running, mdue to the fact that the interrupt occurs inside the refresh loop of the led matrix
	Solutions found: - disable interrupts inside refresh loop: WORKS
			 - PUSH & POP every register used in the interrupt


* Led flickering during simulation, maybe due to the fact that rows stay on longer when interrupt occurs
	No solution found

* X_edges are not taken into account properly, bits check the next adress altough they should be at the edge of the frame.
	Probably due to incorrect coordinates checks

* Some areas of the screen kill anything that passes through, very likely to be the same cause as previous bug
